# 🤖 AI Study Buddy Project – My Journey in Intro to AI Agents (WnCC SoC25)

Hi! I'm **Deblina Biswas**, and this repository documents my 8-week learning journey through the **AI Study Buddy Project**, a hands-on curriculum organized by [WnCC Summer of Code](https://wncc-soc.tech-iitb.org).

Throughout the project, I explored the world of **Agentic AI Systems** — combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory, planning, tool use, and personalization to build an AI chatbot that can assist with studies in an intelligent, interactive way.

## 🧭 Project Summary

The aim was to build a **personalized AI-powered Study Buddy**, capable of:
- Answering questions from documents using **RAG**
- Maintaining **short-term and long-term memory**
- Using **external tools** like Wikipedia search
- Conducting **multi-turn conversations** with context awareness
- Making plans and decisions through **agentic autonomy**
- Collecting feedback and maintaining safety via **guardrails**
- Providing a basic **frontend UI** for real-world interaction

Each folder in this repository (`week1`, `week2`, ..., `week8`) contains my weekly progress — including assignments, mini-projects, and notes.
