    "content": "Newton's Second Law of Motion postulates that, at any given instant, the net external force exerted on a body is quantitatively equal to the product of the body's mass and its acceleration. Formally, this can be expressed as **F = m\u00b7a**, where **F** represents the net force vector, **m** denotes the scalar mass of the body, and **a** is the acceleration vector. This law provides a precise mathematical framework linking force, mass, and acceleration, indicating that an object's acceleration is directly proportional to the net force applied and inversely proportional to its mass.\n\nFurthermore, it can be equivalently stated in terms of momentum change: the net force on a body corresponds to the time rate of change of its linear momentum, encapsulating dynamic scenarios where mass might vary, though typically mass is constant. This foundational principle elucidates how forces influence motion, making it pivotal in predicting the trajectories of particles and rigid bodies within classical mechanics.",
